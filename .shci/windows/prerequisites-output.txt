Chocolatey v2.0.0
2 validations performed. 1 success(es), 1 warning(s), and 0 error(s).

Validation Warnings:
 - A pending system reboot request has been detected, however, this is
   being ignored due to the current Chocolatey configuration.  If you
   want to halt when this occurs, then either set the global feature
   using:
     choco feature enable -name=exitOnRebootDetected
   or pass the option --exit-when-reboot-detected.

Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
 (cmd/powershell).

 You may experience errors - many functions/packages
 require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
 elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure
 that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are
 attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you
 must select a different location other than the default install
 location. See
 https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#non-administrative-install
 for details.
